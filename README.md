## Description
  
Fully functioning React calculator for the PvP aspects of the game City of Heroes (A once popular game by Cryptic Studios, sold to NCSoft, taken off line and now hosted publicly for free by the Homecoming team). There is a huge amount of state management in order to allow the user to modify their attacks with all the same options the game allows. The game itself does not provide detailed information, and there aren't any tools that accurately calculate the diminishing returns the game implements for pvp. This app not only gives you accurate calculations of damage, but also the time at which the damage will hit (which is important for team coordination). 

---
## Installation
  
This is hosted on github.io so there is no need to install

---
## Usage
  
Select your Archtype, Primary blast set, Secondary set, and Epic set.

The sortable table below is clickable, if you click a power it will add it to your attack chain. 

Once in your attack chain you can click on damage to modify the power as you see fit and it will update your damage to true in game numbers post DR.

You can also add debuffs to the target's resistance in your attack chain, also calculated for DR.

Don't like a power? Click remove and it'll be taken out of your chain.
